I had three vehicles insured with them, My home under Home Owners Ins.  and I own an apartment bldg, I have that under a rental policy.  Well my basement got flooded.  All State had me wait over a month for anyone to come out.  They gave the OK to Roto Rooter to remove everything from the basement and a woman came to check the loss and I was informed my home (which I have a mortgage on) was under tenants insurance.  Now they are refusing to pay the Roto Rooter bill of $5,200.  They left my property with everything under tarps for over a second month, they are only covering the loss under renters which is a fifth of what I lost.  I could have donated so much to Salvation Army or Good Will if they just let me know that they were going to cheat me.    They said I had changed from Home Owners to renters Ins in June 18?  That was when I went into the office and increased my renters insurance because I decided to furnish my apartments.  I have heard a lot of reports like this, where All State tries to switch things around to get out of paying a claim.   I will be filing a complaint with the insurance commission. \"STAY CLEAR OF ALL STATE\"", "They send out policies with changes made but don't notify you of the changes. Insurance companies I have spoken to about moving all of our vehicles and cars to say they contact them personally.  They will not cover my son's car even though we have full coverage and ANYONE can drive our cars and be covered. They will cover medical and $100 of towing but not collision. Why can they pick and choose what they want to cover. My son lives with us so he isn't covered. It changed and we received notice in the 16 page renewal a year ago.

One of there insured hit one of my fleet vehicles and it was clearly the fault of the insured according to the police report and my driver. They said they had to do an investigation to determine liability, just to waste some time before helping me. I tried to explain that my service vehicle is hard to replace because it is state inspected and carries a 50 gal tank in the back. I can't rent a vehicle because no one is going to allow me to anchor a tank and modify the truck for my needs. I was told that its my job to \"mitigate damages\"  so I took the truck to the body shop to be fixed. My body shop called them and they said not to do any repairs until an adjuster could look at it but they would not send one out until they determined liability. They also told me that I should call my insurance company to have them look at it, so I can also pay $1000,00 deductible. I started the claims process with my insurance company so that State Farm could call me a day later to tell me they are 100% liable. So I cancel the adjuster I had coming out so they could send theirs which was suppose to come the next day to the body shop. I called 3 days later to be told that the adjuster doesn't work on weekends (the appt was scheduled for Friday) and they should be out soon, it's now Tuesday. The whole time my service vehicle is collecting dust because they won't even allow me to repair it on my own. My employee that normally works in that truck has had to sit at home and lose income because State Farm enjoys dragging their feet instead of getting claims solved. At every turn State Farm has tried hard to make the claims process very hard and I should know, I deal with claims for our entire fleet. State Farm was one of two companies that we were looking at using for our 35 vehicles but I am happy to say I was able to sway the vote to another company  over this incident. I am going to switch my personal insurance that I have on my home with State Farm just so if I ever did need to make a claim I don't have to deal with them.", "Good agent for insurance. i will call them again.", "Worst insurance company.  period.

If you would like  examples, ask for them, I will be happy to provide them. SO, it looks like the best way to keep your rates down on car or house insurance, is to call anonamously to a broker that you dont do biz with,  ask questions as to what should be covered and what isnt, but if you give that guy your name, he may very well put that on your list of rating problems and it will raise your insurance in the future. If you know how to avoid this problem or even get these items removed from an insurance rating, I would like to know what, how and anything else about it. What I am saying is , even with NO CLAIM,even if you had no insurance that covered that problem in any way,you end up with a bad  rating", "I would never have this as my insurance company. Here is why:", "I currently have Nationwide and they are great. My friend hit my car and he has state farm. I filed a claim on sunday. Heard nothing monday so called tuesday. They told me they needed a statement from him so i had him call and give an admittance of fault. He did it same day. Friday rolls around and still no call back. Call them and they tell me sorry its been on my desk since tuesday sorry no one has called by now. Now im angry. They tell me to go to website and find what auto shops they go through. They cant do that for me?? They then tell me i have to contact them and i have to contact the rental car. Basically they do Nothing!! So i called them just to find out what i could have done 3 days ago!!! Screw that company! Nationwide handled my previous claim that i was fault of quickly. They called the repair shop they did it all and wonderful customer service. They are cheaper than all the rest and i think same price as state farm. You get what you pay for people. I will tell everyone i meet not to go through them.", "Cheap, but you get what you pay for. You literally have to argue with them to get them to cover even a dime. I had a leak in a pipe in the wall. A statefarm inspector came to the house and said it was from the roof, but he didn't even go in the attic or get on the roof, so I replaced the roof, but the contractor said it was from a leak in a pipe in the wall, not the roof. I called statefarm to come out a second time to reinspect, since their findings weren't correct. They came out a second time, but wrote it up as a 2nd claim, and of course they didn't cover a dime. Then I called a year later because lightening fried my kitchen appliances, but over the phone they said that the cost of repair would be less than my deductible, so they recommended that I didn't file a claim, which I didn't. However, a month later I received a cancelation letter from statefarm saying due to having three claims. I called to get the claims taken care of, but they couldn't do anything. Now I have three claims, of which insurance never  paid out a dime, but yet still this is making it impossible for me to find an insurance agent, since nobody will accept me with three claims. I have till Dec 6 to find insurance, and I'm really at a loss. I wouldn't recommend StateFarm to anyone.", "When I asked for a quote for home coverage, they sent a nosey woman to my house and said everything was ok to me. Then later I was told the house wasn't safe, my dog was dangerous, and nothing but negatives. They acted so deceiving when they could have been honest.  I was able to get insurance somewhere else without any trouble. I don't recommend this insurance.", "State farm is the worst insurance company out there! Had them for several years auto and home, when it came down to filling a claim they refused it and did not pay 1 red cent, but still raised my premiums", "I was contacted via email with a quote that I was told had all needed legal coverage for my state. After I had signed up and paid in full, Daysi from the office of Mariam Lawson tried to force place the missing coverage on my policy and receive payment. My credit card had expired, so they were unable to get payment. So their solution was to cancel my policy without notifying me first. Have since switched to Traveler's at a cheaper cost AND more coverage. State Farm has treated me well in the past, but because of the office of Mariam Lawson, I will never use them again, and recommend that everyone else checks out other options first.", "Nothing is free today but SF & Lisa Wilde in Mesquite, NV offer a great policy at affordable prices.

We had a claim for 11,000.00 and they spent 3 years and 4 times that amount in lawyers to keep was from getting the claim. The judge even said that it was not right but the wording in policy let's them get away with it. They do nothing in good faith. This is a warning they can not be trusted nor can the companies that are listed with them to do estimate after all they make more money with stae farms then they will with you.", "(Oregon City Oregon) ", "My Fiance had Stephen Santi  and he was nothing but trouble. In and out of the office with no one to take care of business when he was gone. This is just the beginning, my fiance decides to cancel her insurance with Stephen and this was lengthy process. 5 Months to be exact, we are still dealing with it. After being harassed a few times to find out agent she went to, because he did not believe it was possible for any one to be cheaper, the payment issue started happening. After cancelling her insurance, they still took money out, two months in a row, then finally State Farm Sent her some money. Well great, we got the money, they sent her a check. She deposited it, then put a stop payment on the check. Her Bank Charged her $10 for that. SO.... Stephen is not helpful or responsible, Money kept being drawn from her account after being cancelled, and the refund process is still not working out well.", "No way! I have had State Farm since I started to drive at 16. Then when it came to buying a house, I went with State Farm, over 25 years now I have been with them.  Then in 2011 (in the state of Ohio...Miami County), we called the insurance company to tell them we thought we might have ice damage to the roof. Instead of them telling me to get an estimate, they sent an adjuster out to my house and said we were better off fixing it ourselves. So we did. They filed that as a CLAIM with a ZERO amount claim! Really?! Then our area had multiple storms, right after one another, during the summer of 2012, which ripped pieces off the roof. They paid for partial payment and we paid the rest so the roof would match. I got a letter 6 months, or so later, from State Farm when my policy was about to expire to tell me they were canceling me because I had too many claims.... When I never received any money from them in the first place with their first &quot;claim&quot;,  and it was never actually a claim!  All insurance companies I am trying to get quotes from, so I can replace them, are like &quot;are you serious?! That is not even considered a claim with the first one.&quot; And all have given me quotes and laugh at State Farm.", "Not worth the time or headache.

I pay over $1,000 a year for car insurance and on October 21, 2009 I was involved in a single vehicle accident.  I filed my claim promptly following my release from the emergency room.  I was informed that an adjustor would be in touch with me within 24 hours.  I contacted Geico on 10/23/2009 after not hearing from an adjustor.  I was told at that time that my car had been picked up from Lee Hi Travel Plaza in Lexington, VA and was being transported to the total loss center.  Saturday and Sunday are nonworking days for the adjustor therefore he would contact me on Monday, October 26, 2009, which he did.  He stated that the car was a total loss and he was submitting the report to Geico that day.  I check online on 10/27/2009 and the report was available on the Geico website dated 10/27/2009.  I called the adjustor on 10/28/2009 and asked him what the next step was.  He informed me that Geico would contact me and send me the paperwork needed to complete the claim.  I checked online every day until November 3, 2009.  At which time I contacted the adjustor again to find out why Geico had not contacted me.  He stated he would call them and find out.  I called Geico directly on November 5, 2009 and stated that I had not received any paperwork.  I was told there was a hold up that no information had been received from the adjustor therefore; I would need to contact the adjustor again.  I promptly called the adjustor who stated that he gave Geico the information and he did not know what the holdup was.  Geico called me back ten minutes later to tell me that I needed to send the signed title into the salvage department.  I mailed the title on November 9, 2009 via priority mail.  It was delivered on 11/15/2009.  I contacted Geico today, 11/16/2009 and was told that it has not been received or processed at this time and that my rental coverage would not be extended past my policy limit regardless of the fact that GEICO, NOT ME has delayed this whole process.  My rental will expire on 11/18/2009.  I am pissed to say the least that I still do not have a check and now will not have a rental car because Geico cannot communicate with its adjustors and vice versa.  I am told there is nothing to be done that I am at my policy limit and that is it.  I think it is outrageous that my hard earned money goes to an insurance company that will drag their feet on a claim until I am at my coverage limit.  Then tell me there is nothing they can do for me even though the delay is on them.  I now will not have a rental car nor a check to rectify the situation.  I am anger and upset and will be switching my coverage to another company as soon as I can find a new car (if I ever received a check).  My car and renters insurance will be with another company as soon as possible.  I understand I am but one measly little customer to you in the scheme of things and none of this will matter to you but I will make sure my voice is heard.

I am requesting for a full and complete investigation pursuant the below Business and Professions Code, for \"Unfair Practices and Bad Faith Practices.\"", "I have All State Insurance,  I initially ordered insurance over the phone to Mr. Whitehead's Office; but I like to deal with people directly not over the phone.   I had three vehicles insured with them, My home under Home Owners Ins.  and I own an apartment bldg, I have that under a rental policy.  Well my basement got flooded.  All State had me wait over a month for anyone to come out.  They gave the OK to Roto Rooter to remove everything from the basement and a woman came to check the loss and I was informed my home (which I have a mortgage on) was under tenants insurance.  Now they are refusing to pay the Roto Rooter bill of $5,200.  They left my property with everything under tarps for over a second month, they are only covering the loss under renters which is a fifth of what I lost.  I could have donated so much to Salvation Army or Good Will if they just let me know that they were going to cheat me.    They said I had changed from Home Owners to renters Ins in June 18?  That was when I went into the office and increased my renters insurance because I decided to furnish my apartments.  I have heard a lot of reports like this, where All State tries to switch things around to get out of paying a claim.   I will be filing a complaint with the insurance commission. \"STAY CLEAR OF ALL STATE\"", "They send out policies with changes made but don't notify you of the changes. Insurance companies I have spoken to about moving all of our vehicles and cars to say they contact them personally.  They will not cover my son's car even though we have full coverage and ANYONE can drive our cars and be covered. They will cover medical and $100 of towing but not collision. Why can they pick and choose what they want to cover. My son lives with us so he isn't covered. It changed and we received notice in the 16 page renewal a year ago.  After 26 years with All State it is time to change and I don't care if my rates are higher. We need an agent that is more personable and will actually speak to us. Bret is never at the offices even when I call every location. If you are ever unhappy with insurance companies file a formal complaint with the Illinois Department of Insurance, they love that."]},

One of there insured hit one of my fleet vehicles and it was clearly the fault of the insured according to the police report and my driver. They said they had to do an investigation to determine liability, just to waste some time before helping me. I tried to explain that my service vehicle is hard to replace because it is state inspected and carries a 50 gal tank in the back. I can't rent a vehicle because no one is going to allow me to anchor a tank and modify the truck for my needs. I was told that its my job to \"mitigate damages\"  so I took the truck to the body shop to be fixed. My body shop called them and they said not to do any repairs until an adjuster could look at it but they would not send one out until they determined liability. They also told me that I should call my insurance company to have them look at it, so I can also pay $1000,00 deductible. I started the claims process with my insurance company so that State Farm could call me a day later to tell me they are 100% liable. So I cancel the adjuster I had coming out so they could send theirs which was suppose to come the next day to the body shop. I called 3 days later to be told that the adjuster doesn't work on weekends (the appt was scheduled for Friday) and they should be out soon, it's now Tuesday. The whole time my service vehicle is collecting dust because they won't even allow me to repair it on my own. My employee that normally works in that truck has had to sit at home and lose income because State Farm enjoys dragging their feet instead of getting claims solved. At every turn State Farm has tried hard to make the claims process very hard and I should know, I deal with claims for our entire fleet. State Farm was one of two companies that we were looking at using for our 35 vehicles but I am happy to say I was able to sway the vote to another company  over this incident.

SO, it looks like the best way to keep your rates down on car or house insurance, is to call anonamously to a broker that you dont do biz with,  ask questions as to what should be covered and what isnt, but if you give that guy your name, he may very well put that on your list of rating problems and it will raise your insurance in the future. If you know how to avoid this problem or even get these items removed from an insurance rating, I would like to know what, how and anything else about it. What I am saying is , even with NO CLAIM,even if you had no insurance that covered that problem in any way,you end up with a bad  rating", "I would never have this as my insurance company.

They told me they needed a statement from him so i had him call and give an admittance of fault. He did it same day. Friday rolls around and still no call back. Call them and they tell me sorry its been on my desk since tuesday sorry no one has called by now. Now im angry. They tell me to go to website and find what auto shops they go through. They cant do that for me?? They then tell me i have to contact them and i have to contact the rental car. Basically they do Nothing!! So i called them just to find out what i could have done 3 days ago!!! Screw that company! Nationwide handled my previous claim that i was fault of quickly. They called the repair shop they did it all and wonderful customer service. They are cheaper than all the rest and i think same price as state farm. You get what you pay for people. I will tell everyone i meet not to go through them.", "Cheap, but you get what you pay for. You literally have to argue with them to get them to cover even a dime. I had a leak in a pipe in the wall. A statefarm inspector came to the house and said it was from the roof, but he didn't even go in the attic or get on the roof, so I replaced the roof, but the contractor said it was from a leak in a pipe in the wall, not the roof. I called statefarm to come out a second time to reinspect, since their findings weren't correct. They came out a second time, but wrote it up as a 2nd claim, and of course they didn't cover a dime. Then I called a year later because lightening fried my kitchen appliances, but over the phone they said that the cost of repair would be less than my deductible, so they recommended that I didn't file a claim, which I didn't. However, a month later I received a cancelation letter from statefarm saying due to having three claims. I called to get the claims taken care of, but they couldn't do anything. Now I have three claims, of which insurance never  paid out a dime, but yet still this is making it impossible for me to find an insurance agent, since nobody will accept me with three claims. I have till Dec 6 to find insurance, and I'm really at a loss. I wouldn't recommend StateFarm to anyone.", "When I asked for a quote for home coverage, they sent a nosey woman to my house and said everything was ok to me.

Then in 2011 (in the state of Ohio...Miami County), we called the insurance company to tell them we thought we might have ice damage to the roof. Instead of them telling me to get an estimate, they sent an adjuster out to my house and said we were better off fixing it ourselves. So we did. They filed that as a CLAIM with a ZERO amount claim! Really?! Then our area had multiple storms, right after one another, during the summer of 2012, which ripped pieces off the roof. They paid for partial payment and we paid the rest so the roof would match. I got a letter 6 months, or so later, from State Farm when my policy was about to expire to tell me they were canceling me because I had too many claims.... When I never received any money from them in the first place with their first &quot;claim&quot;,  and it was never actually a claim!  All insurance companies I am trying to get quotes from, so I can replace them, are like &quot;are you serious?!

Well, I am the only one that drives in my family, a single mom and no other way to get to my job 20 miles away.

Has taken over a month for them to send me the check from my totaled car. Had to talk with four people because no one knew how to fill out the power of attorney form that THEY sent to me. Either they're complete idiots or they are trying to delay sending me the check-probably both. Finally found someone who knew how to fill it out...or so I thought. Got a call a week later saying I filled it out wrong. So I have to fill it out again, get it notarized again, mail it back to them again. Hopefully this time it's right, as its been a month that I've been waiting for this check. In the meantime I had to get a new car without being able to put that check toward the downpayment, because they wouldn't extend my rental car even though this delay was THEIR fault.

I have three vehicles on the policy all with liability coverage only. I have a teenage son on the policy. He had a wreck in Aug 2008. They paid out 2400.00 in claims. The next time we came up for renewal there was no change in the price for the coverages. Then my wife was involved in an accident in Oct. 2009, she was hit by an insured driver and Geico did not have to pay out any thing. I received a letter in Dec 2009 stating that Geico was cancelling my policy affective my next renewal date due to the accident that my wife had. They said that they can renew my insurance with there other carrier for a little more increase in price. My old policy was $600.00 for 6 months and the new policy would be $2600.00 for 6 months. I don't think this is a fair practice for Insurance companies to screw the public like this, that is why I am writing this to vent my frustrations. I any body wants to know who I am my name is Randy Newbury. My phone number is 214-902-9996 and my policy number with Geico was 4124190994.

I sent this letter to the Corporate office today.", "November 16, 2009", "To Whom It May Concern:", "I would like to inform you of my recent experience with Geico Claims.  I pay over $1,000 a year for car insurance and on October 21, 2009 I was involved in a single vehicle accident.  I filed my claim promptly following my release from the emergency room.  I was informed that an adjustor would be in touch with me within 24 hours.  I contacted Geico on 10/23/2009 after not hearing from an adjustor.  I was told at that time that my car had been picked up from Lee Hi Travel Plaza in Lexington, VA and was being transported to the total loss center.  Saturday and Sunday are nonworking days for the adjustor therefore he would contact me on Monday, October 26, 2009, which he did.  He stated that the car was a total loss and he was submitting the report to Geico that day.  I check online on 10/27/2009 and the report was available on the Geico website dated 10/27/2009.  I called the adjustor on 10/28/2009 and asked him what the next step was.  He informed me that Geico would contact me and send me the paperwork needed to complete the claim.  I checked online every day until November 3, 2009.  At which time I contacted the adjustor again to find out why Geico had not contacted me.  He stated he would call them and find out.  I called Geico directly on November 5, 2009 and stated that I had not received any paperwork.  I was told there was a hold up that no information had been received from the adjustor therefore; I would need to contact the adjustor again.  I promptly called the adjustor who stated that he gave Geico the information and he did not know what the holdup was.  Geico called me back ten minutes later to tell me that I needed to send the signed title into the salvage department.  I mailed the title on November 9, 2009 via priority mail.  It was delivered on 11/15/2009.  I contacted Geico today, 11/16/2009 and was told that it has not been received or processed at this time and that my rental coverage would not be extended past my policy limit regardless of the fact that GEICO, NOT ME has delayed this whole process.  My rental will expire on 11/18/2009.  I am pissed to say the least that I still do not have a check and now will not have a rental car because Geico cannot communicate with its adjustors and vice versa.  I am told there is nothing to be done that I am at my policy limit and that is it.  I think it is outrageous that my hard earned money goes to an insurance company that will drag their feet on a claim until I am at my coverage limit.  Then tell me there is nothing they can do for me even though the delay is on them.  I now will not have a rental car nor a check to rectify the situation.  I am anger and upset and will be switching my coverage to another company as soon as I can find a new car (if I ever received a check).  My car and renters insurance will be with another company as soon as possible.  I understand I am but one measly little customer to you in the scheme of things and none of this will matter to you but I will make sure my voice is heard.  I will make sure all my friends and family never obtains insurance with your company!

What kind of insurance company refuses to replace glass? This winter i will not be surprised if the windshield smashes in, and i have no way to keep it from happening. And i thought in the state of kentucky they were required too replace it one time... Watch me loose my job because i cant get to work this winter.", "A rock hit my windshield while driving on the highway and created a quarter-sized nick. Geico fixed my nick for free and it is not considered a claim!", "I have been w/geico for over 10 yrs...... low rate good service", "I had gotten in a accident and right then and there they gave me a rental car info and when i can take my car to get it fixed. i did have great service and very prompt however they way more expensive then most insurance companies, at least for me bein young."]},
